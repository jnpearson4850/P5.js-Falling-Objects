# P5.js-Falling-Objects

**Falling Game**
Link to the live Page- (COMING SOON)

**Description**

This project is a simple falling objects game. The goal is for the user to avoid the blocks moving toward them for as long as possible. In future updates I will be adding a Rick and Morty theme, as well as a clock so the user can track how long they stayed alive. 


**What I decided to learn and Why**

I choose P5.js. It seemed like a fun way to work on my Javascript skills as well as learn a new library. In addition to learning a new library it taught me how to add one into a project. Also, P5 was geared toward making games and fun visuals. Both are something I naturally gravitate toward.   


**My Process for learning**

I stated looking into P5 last week we I knew we would be doing a teach yourself day. From there I went to the P5JS.org web page to read documentation and best practices. The website has a wealth of information and is very good at explaining techniques and procedures in basic terms. From there I sketched out the game I wanted to make and went to town on it. I was able to use several GitHub pages to find examples of what I was trying to do and a good tutorial on implementing P5.play. 

**List of Technologies used**
